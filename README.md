# C26Final
LastOne
This is the last assignment for CodeFellows C26. The intent is to demonstrate some data visualization methods and use jQuery, along with JavaScript and CSS to make an attractive, functioning site. 

The program plays the game of WAR with a dealt set of cards. The cards are only DOM elements and are manipulated around the DOM as the play progresses. An array of objects is used in scoring each hand.

I chose to build off the class example of shuffling cards for a couple of reasons. The first is that I tend to over-complicate things like this because I tend to think of complicated problems - sorting through population, commute times, and vehicle registrations for global metropolitan areas, for example. You know, the stuff that I'm working towards. So, to break stride, I thought I'd get the card exercise working, which was good, since I had wanted to make that work anyway.
